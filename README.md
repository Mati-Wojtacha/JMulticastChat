# JMulticastChat
This project is a Java implementation of a multicast chat system that allows multiple users to communicate with each other using UDP multicast sockets.

The project also uses jSwing to create a graphical user interface for the chat system, as shown in the images . Additionally, the project separates the communication responsible for adding and removing new users from the chat conversation, which significantly improves the performance. The system uses a different port for managing the user list than for sending and receiving chat messages. This is a brief and concise description of the project.
